Created by: Ismail Ali and Jeffrey Zhu

In this project there is a menu that lets two players decide their characters.
There are 11 characters to choose from.
The user can choose how many lives they get and choose the map to play on.

Each character has 3 attacks.
One attack is a normal attack.
Another attacks is a strong attack which does more damage than a normal attack but also takes a longer time to hit.
Ait attack is an attack that the player can do in the air.

A player can lose a life once they fall of the stage.
The greater the players hit points(hp) the further the player will be knocked back.
If a player loses all their lives they lose the game.
If a player has less lives once the timer ends the player loses.
